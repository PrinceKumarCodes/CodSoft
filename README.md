# Introduction

   Hey Everyone! 👋
    I'm Prince Kumar, currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Applications (BCA) at  Bharati Vidyapeeth Institute of Management and Research in Delhi.
    I have successfully completed my first Virtual Internship in Web Development with CodSoft in July 2024! 🏅


 # Internship Tasks Highlights
 
 
- Task 1: `Personal Portfolio`
  
   -> For my first task, I developed a Personal Portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
   This project helped me understand how to structure a personal webpage and showcase my skills, projects, and experience effectively.
